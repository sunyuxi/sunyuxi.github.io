I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, under the supervision of Dr. Yunming Ye. My current research interest is content-based remote sensing (RS) image retrieval, including uni-modal RS image retrieval and multi-modal RS image retrieval. From 2017 to 2020, I worked in the multi-modal image search group of Sogou Inc., which is the second-largest search engine company in China. Before that, I received my B.Sc and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science from Changchun University of Science and Technology and Harbin Institute of Technology in 2014 and 2017 respectively.
